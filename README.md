## What is a Pareto-front?

When the different objectives are contradictory, an optimal solution is said Pareto optimal when it is not possible to improve an objective without degrading the others. A Pareto optimal solution can then be seen as an optimal trade-off between the objectives. The set of all Pareto optimal solutions is called the Pareto-front as it usually graphically forms a distinct front of points. Solutions which do not lay on the Pareto front are called Pareto dominated solutions.
