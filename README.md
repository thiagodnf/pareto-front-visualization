# Pareto-front Visualization

A Pareto-front visualization developed in HTML

## What is a Pareto-front?

When the different objectives are contradictory, an optimal solution is said Pareto optimal when it is not possible to improve an objective without degrading the others. A Pareto optimal solution can then be seen as an optimal trade-off between the objectives. The set of all Pareto optimal solutions is called the Pareto-front as it usually graphically forms a distinct front of points. Solutions which do not lay on the Pareto front are called Pareto dominated solutions.

## For Developers

Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  npm start
    Starts the development server.

  npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  npm test
    Starts the test runner.

  npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd pareto-front-visualization
  npm start
